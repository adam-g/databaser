			c)	The credit card number can be protected from hackers by storing encrypted values in the database. 

			e) 	Three reasons for doing processing in stored procedures instead of doing them on the client 
				side (i.e. javascript)
				
					1. 	MySQL stored procedures are compiled on demand, after compilation they are 
						stored in cache. Every single connection maintains it's own stored 
						procedures cache and if the same procedure is used multiple times the 
						compiled version is used. If the procedure is called once the stored 
						procedure works as a query instead. _This increases the performance of 
						applications._

					2.  _Stored procedures reduces traffic between the server and the application._ 
						Instead of sending multiple queries, only the name and the parameters of 
						the procedure has to be sent from the client. 

					3. 	_Stored procedures provides security._ Permissions can be given to 
						applications making them able to access appropriate stored procedures, 
						without giving them permissions to the underlying tables.
